	  <div class="stepContent">

		<div class="stepDescription">
		  <p> Once all your important reservations are booked and you have reviewed local guidlines for health safety.</p> 
		<ol> Consider learning more about the local culture and customs of your destination.</ol>
		<ol>Research unique experiences and local foods.</ol>
		<ol>Most importantly, <strong> go off the beaten path</strong>. Get to know the locals, try to learn a few key words in their native language</ol> 
		<ol> Test your language skills with sites like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">Babbel</a>.</ol>
			<p> <strong>Don't stress</strong>. Travel is not meant to cause anxiety or panic. It is an opportunity to learn by exploring outside your comfort zone.</p>
			
			<p> <strong>Have fun and safe travels! </strong></p>
