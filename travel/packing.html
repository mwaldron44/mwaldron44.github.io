<p>Several factors can dictate the right type of suitcase for a particular trip, including your destination, intended length of stay, airline baggage policies, and more. A suitcase that's larger than you need can be a real hassle, while a small bag can limit you.</p>	
			<p> There are positives and negatives all bag types, but first let's consider how you travel!</p>
			<p> Do you like to have your hands free while in route to your destination? Or are you okay managing multiple processes while on the road? </p>
			<p> For the traveler who enjoys carefree journeys, these are the bag types that might be a good fit: </p>
			<ol> <strong>Backpacks</strong>: consider a well-balanced bag that has enough large storage for clothes and technology but also small pockets for travel documents, small tech, and snacks.</ol> 
			<ol>*A small note about backpacks - Individuals with bad backs should avoid using a backpack or overloading a bag of this type. </ol>	
			<ol> <strong>Carry-on roller bag</strong>: A bag that is easy to carry on a plane and lift over your head for stowage is highly recommended for hassle-free travel.</ol>
			<ol> The typical carry-on size for most airlines is up to 45 inches. Even on a roller bag it is possible to overload it or poorly balance items inside. <strong>Do not overpack!</strong></ol>
			<ol> For travelers that need to have a larger bag size, consider checking a larger roller bag. Sometimes there are items you can't leave behind or buy at your destination. For example, CPAP machines. IN these instnces I recommend that you carry them on in their own case and make sure it has all the extra pockets you need so that the checked bag only has clothes. </ol>

		<p align="left">The biggest rule of travel is <strong> DON'T OVERPACK.</strong></p>
		<p> Every traveler will pack differently and define items of importance in their own contenxt. These tips on packing are meant to help you evlaute your individual needs during travel and learn important lessons about what is important and necessary while in transit and at your destination.</p>
<ol>
<li> Let's start easy - consider how may outfits you need for a week long vacation. Keep in mind that you should always bring clothing that is breathable, easily washable, and can be worn multiple times. As an example, for a 7-day trip a traveler could pack 2-3 pairs of pants and shirts. This would offer clothing cobinations in excess of what is needed for 7 days.</li>
	<br><br>	
<li> Next, be sure that toiletries are in an approved travel size container and that all items considered liquid are then placed in a clear quart sized bag that zips shut. Please consult your travel advisories for your local airport and destination to ensure that this is proper policy. Lastly, remember that larger items with liquid need to be placed in a check bag. If you are not checking a bag, be sure you follow travel guidance.</li>
<br><br>	
<li>Now, how do you make it all fit in a small bag? There are a variety of ways to pack smart. First, you can purchase a compression bag. These bags are sold usually in the travel sections of most stores. You fill the bag with you clothing folder as flat and small as possible (i.e. button shirts, zip pants). slide the clothes inside the bag, use the plastic zipper to close, and roll and excess air out of the bag. This will reduce the overall weight and space your clothing will take up in your bag. Next, many people recommend rolling clothes or using stacking cases. These are all viable options to fit more in your bag or reduce the weight burden.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, I want to make a few recommendations of items that you should carry with you on your journey to keep you happy and comfortable.</p>
<ol> travel laundry bar</ol> 
<ol> rubber clothesline</ol>
<ol> wireless earbuds or wired as most planes still have not upgraded to wireless options.</ol>
<ol> a thin jacket, sweater, or blanket. Depending on your bag, you may be able to attach these items to the outside. </ol>
